    <p>
        Whether I am creating responsive front-end applications, elegant and efficient server-side logic, or chasing pixel-perfection
        in front-end layouts, I love my job; and for the past eight years have pursued becoming the best web developer I can be.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe that being an effective developer means creating solutions that not only work in the present, but that will be cost
        effective and flexible as business needs change over time. I believe that choosing the right tools for the job is as important
        as being able to build things from scratch and I believe that the science of software development facilitates the art that
        is user-interface design.
    </p>
    <p>
        I pride myself on my ability to communicate, work hard, have fun, and build kick-ass websites.

        Adam gets the job done on time, on budget and he exceeds expectations. Adam took the time to understand our needs and got us what we wanted within a very limited budget. He constantly offered creative solutions to our problems and at the end of the day the product was better than we had imagined when we started. I would not hesitate to hire Adam again.

        For the past 10 months I have been gainfully employed at <a href="https://beta.apptui.com/">Apptui Inc.</a>
        where I am a senior front-end developer. The samples below represent recent side projects that I am able to claim responsibility for.
        In addition to the work below you can browse my repos on <a href="https://github.com/adampetrie">GitHub</a>, see my activity on

            <p>
                Cinephile is a sample Javascript application that I built to further my understanding of single page application
                development. The application leverages the TMDb API to allow users to search for movies and keep a list of their
                favourites. Cinephile is powered by Backbone.js and was
                scaffolded using Yeoman. You can browse the source code <a href="https://github.com/adampetrie/cinephile">here</a> and see the app in action

                United Way Oakville approached me looking to have their site site designed and built using the WordPress platform. Included in their site is
                a donation page that was integrated with Moneris Systems as a payment provider. You can browse the site <a href="http://www.uwoakville.org">here</a>.

        Adam is always looking at not just the task at hand but how it impacts the business objectives of the client and company and whether the solution will achieve the desired effects. He is able to communicate not just with his peers but directly with clients and knows what questions to ask to get to the heart of the task/project.
